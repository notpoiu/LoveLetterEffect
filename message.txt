Olivia,

Happy late 16th birthday, I'm sorry I didn't wish you on the original day, I told myself i'd ask you a week ago. I had to cross my fingers everyday and wish I didn't miss it, but i did! May 16 treat you well because it truly is the best age for me. I hope junior year treats you well and you take care of your mental health. I look foreard to seeing you again at school and making more memories. Thank you for being apart of my life, i'll always pray for you. Anyway it's almost 3 am rn and i couldn't sleep until i coded this, so enjoy your life. Stay happy, love you!
